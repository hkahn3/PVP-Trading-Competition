# PVP-Trading-Competition
In this project my goal is to create a web app where players can set up paper trading competitions using data from the live stock market. Users will be able to create competitions with specific details such as: starting cash, amount of trades, length of competition, first-to style competitions, the ability to see other competitors portfolios and watch lists.
