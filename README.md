# PVP-Trading-Competition
In this project my goal is to create a web app where players can set up paper trading competitions using data from the live stock market. Users will be able to create competitions with specific details such as: starting cash, amount of trades, length of competition, first-to style competitions, the ability to see other competitors portfolios and watch lists.



At first this web app will be very simple. 
Upon opening the page users will see games they are apart of as well as buttons to create or join a new game. 

The games will consist of many players competeting over who can do the best in the stock market. It will include the option to bet on yourself and others cause why the hell wouldn't it?
